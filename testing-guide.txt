== How to Setup VSC for Running Unit Tests ==
1. Open up a PowerShell terminal (Terminal->New Terminal) and made sure your have all the latest dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Open the extensions pane and search for 'Test Explorer UI' and install it.
3. You should now see the 'Testing' pane on the sidebar. You may need to restart VSC.
4. IMPORTANT: In order to run the tests, the node.js server must be running. Start the server by running the `node server.js` command.
5. You can click the run button at the top to run all the tests, or run a specific one. (Keep in mind, some tests may rely on other tests.)
6. If a test fails, you can click on it and see why in the console.
6. CTRL+C kills the node server.

== Writing a Test ==
1. All tests must go in the 'test' folder.
2. It would probably be best to sort tests by route.
3. See usage-views.js as a good example.
4. The before(() => ) function runs code that "sets up" a test. It should have behavior that is needed before a test can run. In the usage-views.js example, it creates a session to be used while running the tests, as a session is needed for testing views.
5. Then, each possible route is tested. Some tests check for results that match the input. For example, the parameterless GET route ensures there is at least one test.
6. The POST is done first to create a new view page, and the ID is acquired.
7. The DELETE is done last to remove the created view page.
8. The after(() => ) function disposes of the created test session.
